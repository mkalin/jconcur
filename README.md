# Java Concurrent Programming

This ZIP file contains four other ZIP files, one apiece for the four class sessions:

   -- day1Morning.zip
   -- day1Afternoon.zip

   -- day2Morning.zip
   -- day2Afternoon.zip  ## also contains comments on the self-test exercises

Each of these ZIP files contains Java source code together with text documents,
which provide overview and summary. Each ZIP file also has a Readme, which explains
the order in which the material is going to be covered.

Welcome to course. I hope you find the material as fascinating as I do.
