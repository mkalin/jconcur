# Java Concurrent Programming

This ZIP file contains four other ZIP files, one apiece for the four class sessions:

   -- day1Morning.zip
   -- day1Afternoon.zip

   -- day2Morning.zip
   -- day2Afternoon.zip  ## also contains comments on the self-test exercises

Each of these ZIP files contains Java source code together with text documents,
which provide overview and summary. Each ZIP file also has a Readme, which explains
the order in which the material is going to be covered.

The Java source files require only the core Java JDK to compile and run. Some programs
use Java SE 7 features (for example, underscores in numeric constants); hence, core
Java 7 or greater is recommended strongly.

Welcome to course. I hope you find the material as fascinating as I do.
