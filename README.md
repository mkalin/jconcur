This site has four ZIP files to be downloaded, one each for the class sessions:

   -- class1Morning.zip
   -- class1Afternoon.zip

   -- class2Morning.zip
   -- class2Afternoon.zip

Each of these ZIP files contains Java source code together with text documents,
which provide overview and summary. Each ZIP file also has a Readme, which explains
the order in which the material is going to be covered.

Welcome to course. I hope you find the material as important and fascinating as I do.
