Here's a list of the files in the ZIP file class1Afternoon.zip, together with a short 
account of each file.

If you've time, please compile and run the code before class. The numbering
suggests the order in which these files might be looked it. All of the files are
relatively short, and the Java code requires only the core Java JDK to compile and run.

           File                                          Contents

1. dataRacesAndDeadlock.txt        Overview of twin perils in multithreading.

2. dataRace.*.java                 Various code examples of data races and how to avoid them

3. AtomicCounter.java              Review of synchronized blocks with an example of how
                                   an 'atomic counter' might be implemented: using AtomicInteger (best)
                                   and rolling your own (useful for contrast)

2. concurParalContrast.txt         A more detailed analysis of how concurrency and parallelism differ.

3. MultithreadEx.java              A short program to introduce 'automatic multithreading'.
                                   Our 1st look at User versus Daemon threads.

4. UserDaemon.java                 More on User versus Daemon threads: a short experiment.

5. multiP.MultiprocessEx.java      Multiprocessing in Java: not the preferred way to do 
                                   concurrent programming in Java, but included for illustration.
   text.txt                        The sample file for the multiprocessing example (see code
                                   documentation for details).

6. basicC.*.java                   5 Java source files, which together explore the 
                                   multithreading API. We'll drill into this API through 
                                   many more code examples.
