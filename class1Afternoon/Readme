Here's a list of the files in the ZIP file class1Afternoon.zip, together with a short 
account of each file.

If you've time, please compile and run the code before class. The numbering
suggests the order in which these files might be looked at. All of the files are
relatively short, and the Java code requires only the core Java JDK to compile and run.
