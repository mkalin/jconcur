Here's a list of the files in the ZIP file class1Morning.zip, together with a short 
account of each file.

If you've time, please compile and run the code before class. The numbering
suggests the order in which these files might be looked it. All of the files are
relatively short, and the Java code requires only the core Java JDK to compile and run.

1. overviewConcurParal.txt         Review of key concepts such as concurrency, parallelism,
                                   multithreading, and multiprocessing. Multithreading in Java.

2. concurParalContrast.txt         A more detailed analyis of how concurrency and parallism differ.

3. MultithreadEx.java              A short program to introduce 'automatic multithreading'.
                                   Our 1st look at User versus Daemon threads.

4. UserDaemon.java                 More on User versus Daemon threads: a short experiment.

5. multiP.MultiprocessingEx.java   Multiprocessing in Java: not the preferred way to do 
                                   concurrent programming in Java, but included for illustration.

6. basicC.*.java                   5 Java source files, which together explore the 
                                   multithreading API. We'll analyze this API through 
                                   many more code examples.
