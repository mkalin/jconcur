 -- An overview of the Java APIs for concurrent/parallel programming via multithreading

 # The core API centered on the java.lang.Thread class and the java.lang.Runnable interface
   
   ## Programmer creates, starts, coordinates, and otherwise manages the multiple threads

 # The ExecutorService, which provides thread pools and high-level constructs for managing 
   the under-the-hood threads from the pool

 # The ForkJoin framework, suited for the 'scatter/gather' approach to efficient problem-solving
   via multithreading: scatter problem parts to various threads, gather the results together.

   ## Built atop the ExecutorService

 # Parallel streams, again suit for the 'scatter/gather' approach to efficient problem-solving
   via multithreading but specifically in the context of data streams

   ## Built atop the ForkJoin framework
