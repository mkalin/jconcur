/**
   A program to show User and Daemon threads in action:

   Java has two Thread types: User and Daemon. Any Java thread of 
   execution is one or the other. From JDK 1.4 on, a Java thread should
   be implemented as a 'native' thread (under OS control) rather than as
   a 'green' thread (under JVM rather than OS control). Here's the 
   difference between a User and a Daemon thread:

   -- only a User thread can sustain an application, which thus ends if there
      are no more active User threads alive

   -- a Daemon thread is designed to be a 'background worker', a thread that performs
      useful tasks (e.g., garbage collection)  but, by itself, cannot sustain an application

   In general, a Java application begins with the execution of main: the thread that
   executes main (the 'main-thread') is a User thread. A thread (User or Daemon) can 
   create and start other threads (User or Daemon). 

   In a technical sense, any Java application is multithreaded because the runtime (JVM)
   has various Daemon threads executing. Java multithreading becomes particularly 
   interesting and challenging when the programmer constructs, starts, and manages
   other threads.

   In this application, the main-thread creates and then shows an AWT Frame window.
   Although the number and type of threads generated is platform-specific, the
   creation and/or showing of the Frame window results in at least one additional
   User thread other than the main-thread. In this app, the main-thread exits, 
   but not so the other User thread(s) associated with the Frame window.

   To exit the application, hit Control-C from the command-line.
