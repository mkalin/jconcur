 Overview of the ForkJoin framework

 # At the core of the ForkJoin framework is the ForkJoinPool class, which implements the
   AbstractExecutorService interface.

   ## In effect, then, the framework is built atop the ExecutorService.

 # A ForkJoinPool can be described as an ExecutorService that supports automatic 'task stealing': any 
   worker thread associated with a task pool looks for tasks to perform, even 'stealing' a task that's 
   been put in some other worker thread's queue.

   ## The goal is flexibility: divy up the tasks among the threads in the course of task processing,
      moving tasks from one work queue to another in the interest of efficiency.

   ## A 'stealing pool' can be configured using the ExecutorService, but the ForkJoin framework provides
      such a pool by default.

 # There's a default 'Common Pool' that an app can use: any task not assigned to some other Pool goes
   into the Common Pool.

   ## If an app requires a customized task pool, then one of the parameterized ForkJoinPool constructors (or
      command-line arguments) can be used.

 # The ForkJoin framework, in turn, is used to support the 'parallel streams' behind the stream API.
