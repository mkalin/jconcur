 -- Streams and lambdas (and a little on method references)

  # A 'stream' is a conveyor-belt of items, which are delivered in an efficient (lazy, as needed) manner.

    ## A stream is thus an iteration construct.

    ## Standard Java collections and other data sources (e.g., files, sockets) can be 'streamified'.

  # A lambda is an anonymous or unnamed function that need not be encapsulated in a class.

    ## The syntax is relatively simple, and the compiler will figure out data types.

       argument-list -> body

       n -> n * n  // single argument, return value is square of argument

    ## If there are multiple args, these must be parenthesized and comma-delimited:

       (n, m) -> n * m

    ## Explicit bodies with return statements are possible, but are not required if the
       body consists of a single expression:

       (n, m) -> { return n * m; }  // ok
       (n, m) -> n * m              // easier to type and to read
-----

  # The stream API includes powerful, higher-order functions such as 'filter' and 'map'
    that can be used to process streamed items.

  # Lambdas and method references are obvious candidates as arguments for higher-order
    stream functions such as 'filter' and 'map':

    -- filters allow certain elements to pass through to downstream pipeline stages,
       but stop others from doing so.

       Example: 

	    IntStream
	    .range(1, 65)                   // generate a stream of int values
	    .filter(i -> ((i & 0x1) == 0))  // even parity?
            ...

    -- maps allow arbitrary transformations of streamed values.

       Example (in this case, the specialized 'flatMap' rather than the general 'map'):

	    lol                             // list of list of integers: [[1, 2, 3], [-9, -8, -7],...]   
	    .parallelStream()               // parallelize the work across worker threads
	    .flatMap(l -> n.stream())       // 'flatten' list-of-lists-of-ints to list of ints
            ...

  # Filters and maps can be arranged and interleaved as needed: as these are higher-order functions,
    the result is a parameterized data pipeline, with functions (lambdas and methods) plugged in as
    arguments.

  # References to methods and lamdbas can be stored in data structures such as maps: a reference is a reference.
