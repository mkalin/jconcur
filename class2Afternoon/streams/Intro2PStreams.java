/**
 * Core Java 8 introduced two major APIs: one for lambdas ('anonymous functions'), 
 * method references, and constructor references; and another for streams. The two
 * are related in that lambdas, method references, and constructor references plug in
 * naturally to streams as arguments to stream functions. The examples below illustrate.
 *
 * Our focus in on parallel streams, which provide a high-level and wonderfully low-fuss
 * way to do multithreading; indeed, the multithreading is basically 'automatic'. The
 * following short examples illustrate.
 *
 * For thread-safety, the lambdas in the following examples are all 'pure functions', that is,
 * functions whose return value depends exclusively on the argument(s) passed to the function.
 * The stream API's higher-order functions such as filter and map ('higher-order' in that these
 * functions can take functions as arguments) encourage the use of pure functions: the simpler, the
 * better -- no side-effects, please!
 *
 * Finally, the program illustrates the 'scatter/gather' idiom: the problem's data are 'scattered' 
 * among different threads for processing, and then 'gathered' at the end into a list.

/** Self-test issues for review
 *
 * The coding examples so far have illustrated four distinct approaches to multithreaded concurrent/parallel programming
 * in Java:
 *
 * -- do-it-yourlself multithreading, with the programmer constructing, starting, synchronizing, and otherwise managing
 *    the started threads: this the core Thread API.
 *
 * -- mulithreading through the ExecutorService, with its built-in thread pools and thread management: built atop the
 *    the core Thread API.
 *
 * -- multithreading through the ForkJoin framework, which is built atop the ExecutorService and provides
 *    even higher-level support for concurrent/parallel programming.
 *
 * -- multithreading through parallel streams, which are built atop the ForkJoin framework and provide
 *    high-level, 'automatic' concurrent/parallel support for processing data streams.
 *
 * Given Java's prominence in enterprise computing, particularly in concurrent programming, there's
 * a wealth of material available on the web and, of course, in books and research papers. Take a look 
 * at resources to refine your judgment about how these different approaches match up with different
 * programming problems. What's good and bad about each of the four approaches? What issues arise?
 *
 * The web has many excellent resources on these issues.
