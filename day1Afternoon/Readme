Here's a list of the files in the ZIP file day1Afternoon.zip, together with a short 
account of each file.

If you've time, please compile and run the code before class. The numbering
indicates the order in which the material in these files will be covered, although 
we won't be going lock-step through each file.

 All of the files are relatively short, and the Java code requires only the core Java JDK to compile and run.
(The basicC Java files use underscores in a numeric constant, which requires core Java 7 or greater.)
