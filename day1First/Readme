Here's a list of the files in the ZIP file day1Morning.zip, together with a short 
account of each file.

If you've time, please compile and run the code before class. The numbering
indicates the order in which the material in these files will be covered, although 
we won't be going lock-step through each file.

 All of the files are relatively short, and the Java code requires only the core Java JDK to compile and run.
(The basicC Java files use underscores in a numeric constant, which requires core Java 7 or greater.)

                                   multithreading, and multiprocessing. Multithreading in Java.

2. concurParalContrast.txt         A more detailed analysis of how concurrency and parallelism differ.

3. divisionOfLabor.txt             Putting the overview altogether with a high-level example.

4. concurrentAPIs.txt              An overview of the Java multithreading APIs to be covered.

5. multiT.MultithreadEx.java       A short program to introduce 'automatic multithreading'.
                                   Our 1st look at User versus Daemon threads.

6. multiT.UserDaemon.java          More on User versus Daemon threads: a short experiment.

7. basicC.*.java                   5 Java source files, which together explore the basics of the
                                   core and ExecutorService multithreading APIs.
                                  
8. multiP.MultiprocessEx.java      Multiprocessing in Java: not the preferred way to do 
                                   concurrent programming in Java, but included for illustration.
   text.txt                        The sample file for the multiprocessing example (see code
                                   documentation for details).
