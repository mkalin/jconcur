/**
   A short application to illustrate User versus Daemon threads.

   -- A Java application remains alive so long as at least one User thread is alive.

   -- If a User thread creates a new thread, that thread is User by default.
      If a Daemon thread creates a new thread, that thread is Daemon by default.
      The status of a thread can be changed by invoking setDaemon(boolean) on the
      thread before the thread is started.

   -- The 'main-thread', which executes main, is a User thread.

   -- If the created thread in this example is a Daemon thread, the program exits when the
      main-thread exits main.

   -- If the created thread in this example is a User thread, the program runs until 
      killed externally (e.g., with Control-C from the command line).

  The JVM uses Daemon threads to provide various services, e.g., garbage-collection.
  Programmer apps can use any mix of User and Daemon threads -- great flexibility.

  The program should be run twice: once with setDaemon(true), once with the line
  commented out (see below).
