package syncREL; // REL for 'ReentrantLock'

/**
 * Another synchronized version of Miser/Spendthrift: there's mutual exclusion on
 * updating the balance. As a result, the balance always winds up as it should: zero.
 *
 * A ReentrantLock has the same 'mutex' semantics as a synchronized block, but a richer
 * and more flexible API. In particular, there are various 'inspection' methods for determining
 * the current state of a Reentrant lock; also, a ReentrantLock can be configured so that
 * interrupting the thread that holds the lock causes that thread to release the lock.
 *
 * The term 'reentrant' is a traditional one, and sometimes the term 'recursive' is used
 * as a synonym so that 'reentrant lock' and 'recursive lock' refer to the same type of
 * mutex structure. In the context of Java, a 'reentrant lock' is one that a given thread
 * can lock and unlock multiple times without deadlocking. In other words, a given thread
 * can 'reenter' critical section code arbitrarily many times.
