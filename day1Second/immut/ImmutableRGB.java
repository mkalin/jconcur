/**
 * Immutable data structures (e.g., java.lang.String) are thereby thread-safe. Thread-safety through
 * immutability is an old idea, and one popularized more recently in Clojure, a modern Lisp 
 * that runs on the JVM. Other languages take this approach as well.
 *
 * The class ImmutableRGB (Red-Green-Blue) is an illustration of a 
 * programmer-defined immutable type. Once created, an ImmutableRGB instance, which
 * represents a particular color, cannot be changed. In more technical language, the state of an 
 * ImmutableRGB instance can't be altered throughout its lifetime. As a result,
 * any ImmutableRGB instance is thread-safe.

/** 
 * Inverting a single instance of an ImmutableRGB is not expensive, but imagine inverting a huge list 
 * of such instances. Once collections (sets, lists, maps) are in play, the issue of efficiency
 * jumps to the forefront for immutable types. The java.util.concurrent package
 * has various collection types that ensure or at least promote thread-safety. This extended 
 * documentation highlights two of these to explore modern approaches to making collections
 * thread-safe yet reasonably efficient.
 *
 * The CopyOnWriteArrayList adapts an approach from memory-management in modern OSes. When one process spawns
 * another in a modern OS, the former is the 'parent' and the latter the 'child'. The child inherits the 'pages'
 * (memory segments) in the parent's address space. However, if either the parent or the child performs a
 * 'write' operation on a given page, then a copy must be made: the page is no longer shared between the two.
 * This approach is known by the acronym COW (Copy On Write).
 *
 * As the name indicates, that's the approach taken in the CopyOnWriteArrayList, a thread-safe version of the 
 * java.util.ArrayList. Consider this scenario. Thread t1 is traversing such a list, performing only 'read' operations. 
 * At the same time, thread t2 'writes' to the list, thereby mutating it. Both operations can proceed without 
 * incident because the traversal occurs on the list as it was the instant the traversal began; and the 
 * 'write' operation generates a _copy_ the original list. In the traversal, t1 might not pick up the change 
 * that t2 makes, depending on whether the 'write' operation precedes the start of the traversal.
 * In applications where 'read' traversals are more common than 'write' operations, this is highly efficient.  
 * The COW approach means, in short, that 'read' ('non-mutating') operations need not be locked.
 * 
 * The ConcurrentHashMap has the same specification as the age-old java.util.Hashtable, which is thread-safe; but the
 * former is more efficient than the latter. Once again, the implementation rests on distinguishing between
 * 'read' (non-mutating) and 'write' (mutating) operations. There is no need to lock an entire ConcurrentHashMap instance,
 * and rarely a need to lock any particular 'read' ('retrieval') operation, which works on a snapshot of the map that 
 * reflects the most recent _completed_ update. If thread t1 is reading a particular value at the same time 
 * that thread t2 is updating that value, then t1 reads the pre-updated value in a spapshot of the 
 * original key/value pair.
