Here's a list of the files in the ZIP file day2Afternoon.zip, together with a short 
account of each file.

If you've time, please compile and run the code before class. The numbering
suggests the order in which these files might be looked at. All of the files are
relatively short, and the Java code requires only the core Java JDK to compile and run.

           File                                          Contents

1. forkJoinOverview.txt            Short overview of the ForkJoin framework.

2. recursiveTasks.txt              An overview of 'recursive tasks' with respect to the ForkJoin framework.

3. lamdbasAndStreams.txt           An overview of the new stream and functional programming APIs
                                   introduced in Java8.

4. fjt.FileSearcher.java           A 'scatter/gather' code example that uses the ForkJoin framework
   fjt.FielSearcherMain.java       directly. In this example, a hierarchical file system is searched
                                   recursively for files with a specified extension.

5. sema.Semaphores.java            An introduction via code to 'counting semaphores', which can be 
                                   configured to allow more than one thread at a time to access 
                                   a protected resource. The documentation clarifies the relationship
                                   between semaphores and the mutexes seen so far.

6. streams.Intro2PStreams.java     An introduction via code to parallel streams, added in Java8.
   streams.Closures.java           The Closures example underscores why lambdas should be implemented
                                   as 'pure functions' to avoid race conditions.
