/**
 * A mutex is a a mutual-exclusion construct. In a multithreading environment, a
 * mutex allows one thread at a time to access a protected resource. In more
 * technical language, a mutex is a binary semaphore, a synchronization construct with exactly
 * two states: access permitted, access prohibited. 
 *
 * However, semaphores can be generalized beyond mutexes, in which case
 * they're known as 'counting semaphores', which can allow a specified number of threads 
 * to access a protected resource. A counting semphore might be described 
 * as a set of permits (e.g., a set of four). The logic is then:
 *
 * -- If there's a permit available, give it to a thread that invokes acquire().
 *
 * -- If not, deny the permit and thereby access to the protected resource.
 *
 * -- If a thread holding a permit calls release(), return the permit to the available set.
 * 
 * This code example illustrates how counting semaphores can be used. A set of threads
 * contests for resources (Resource1, Resource2,...), and the application
 * uses a counting semahore to regulate how many resources can be checked out at
 * a time. A sample run generates output such as:
 *  ...
 *  pool-7-thread-1 putting back Resource2
 *  pool-2-thread-1 acquiring Resource2
 *  pool-11-thread-1 putting back Resource1
 *  pool-7-thread-1 acquiring Resource1
 *  pool-1-thread-1 putting back Resource6
 *  pool-11-thread-1 acquiring Resource6
 *  pool-5-thread-1 putting back Resource0
 *  pool-1-thread-1 acquiring Resource0
 *  pool-6-thread-1 putting back Resource7
 *  pool-5-thread-1 acquiring Resource7
 *  pool-8-thread-1 putting back Resource8
 *  pool-6-thread-1 acquiring Resource8
 *  pool-10-thread-1 putting back Resource3
 *  ...
 *
 * The program runs indefinitely: kill at the command-line with Control-C.
