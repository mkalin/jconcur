/**
   Miser/Spendthrift 4: two threads race to update a single memory location
   (static field AccountBQ.balance): the Miser increments the balance, whereas
   the Spendthrift decrements the balance. The balance is zero to begin.

   In this version, there is an additional thread: the Banker thread.
   The Banker alone updates the account balance, with the Miser and Spendthrift 
   threads sending requests (for deposits and withdrawals, respectively) to
   a thread-safe BlockingQueue. The Banker thread reads requests from this queue.
   At the end, the balance is zero.

   Here's a depiction of how the app works:

           deposit requests
                 /                       thread-safe                update the account balance
      Miser---------------+                 /                               /
                          |------------>BlockingQueue<------------Banker--------->balance
      Spendthrift---------+      \                      /                   /
                    \        write operations     read operations     single-threaded access
       withdrawal requests
