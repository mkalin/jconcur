package interrupt;

/**
 * A short program to illustrate how one thread (in this case, the main-thread)
 * can interrupt another thread (in this case, the Thread instance to which t1
 * points). Interruption is a primitive way for two threads to communicate.
 * 
 * In this example, the main-thread constructs and then starts a Thread instance,
 * whose run method contains a loop-until-interrupted construct. The main-thread
 * simulates a coin flip, incrementing a counter on 'tails' (negative values). When
 * the counter hits 4, the main-thread interrupts the started thread. Both
 * threads (each a User thread) then terminate, and the program exits. It's
 * arbitrary whether the main-thread or the started thread exits first.
