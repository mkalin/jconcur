/** 
 * Provide a thread-safe queue for a Producer and Consumer to communicate.
 *
 * The SynchronousQueue is a 'blocking' structure that coordinates insert ('write')
 * and remove ('read') operations: each insert requires a subsequent remove, and each
 * remove depends on a previous insert. Although the term 'queue' suggests a collection of
 * multiple items, the SynchronousQueue is, at the implementation level, simply a mechanism
 * that allows a producer and a consumer share items strictly one-at-a-time, but in a thread-safe
 * manner: one or more threads can produce, and others can consume. 
 *
 * There are three User threads at play: the main-thread in ProducerConsumerDriver (this file),
 * the producer thread, and the consumer thread. The main-thread starts the other two, and then
 * terminates by exiting main.
 *
 * Here's a depiction of the application:
 * 
 *         a write of "done" signals the Producer is finished producing
 *               /
 *            write                        read
 *  Producer---------->SynchronousQueue<----------Consumer
 *                          /                \
 *                    thread-safe       read until "done" is encountered             
 *
