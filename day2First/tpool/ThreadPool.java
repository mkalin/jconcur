package tpool;

/** 
 * Any job submitted to the thread pool must implement Runnable by defining the run() method:
 *
 *    public MyJob implements Runnable { 
 *       public MyJob(String name) { ... }
 *
 *       @Override
 *  	 public void run() { ... } // run implements whatever logic the job requires
 *       ...
 *    }
 *
 * A job may be submitted for exeucution to a thread pool of N threads:
 *
 *    MyJob job1 = new MyJob("play a game");
 *    MyJob job2 = new MyJob("compress the database");
 *    ...
 *    ThreadPool tpool = new ThreadPool(8); // 8 threads in the pool
 *    tpool.execute(job1); // the tpool now provides the thread
 *    tpool.execute(job2); // ditto
 *    ...
 *
 * For ReentrantLocks, as against synchronized blocks, the wait/notify methods are
 * bundled into the java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition interface. Accordingly, this
 * thread pool implementation would replace the wait/notify constructs with
 * their Condition counterparts await/signal, if ReentrantLocks were used in place of
 * synchronized blocks.
