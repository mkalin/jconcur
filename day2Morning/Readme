Here's a list of the files in the ZIP file day2Morning.zip, together with a short 
account of each file.

If you've time, please compile and run the code before class. The numbering
suggests the order in which these files might be looked at. All of the files are
relatively short, and the Java code requires only the core Java JDK to compile and run.

           File                                            Contents

1. clientServer.EchoServer.java       A sample concurrent server, with emphasis on its inefficient use of
   clientServer.EchoClient.java       threads as client-handling workers

2. tpool.ThreadPool.java              A home-grown implementation of a thread pool, which introduces new aspects
   tpool.DriverTP.java                of the core Thread API. 

3. interrupt.ThreadInterrupt          A program to illustrate thread communciation via interrupts

4. producerConsumer.*.java            An example in 3 .java files to introduce queues, which
                                      then are used in the next example for inter-thread communication

5. bq.AccoutBQ.java                   A example to focus further on two points: (a) use of thread-safe 
   bq.RaceConditionBQ.java            queues instead of explicit locking to prevent race conditions;
                                      (b) the constant danger of deadlock.
