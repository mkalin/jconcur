/** 
 * The recursive task is to search a hierarchical file system for
 * files with a given extension (e.g., ".txt" or ".java"), starting at
 * the specified path (e.g., "/home/fred"). A list of such files is returned.
 *
 * Here's a simplified depiction, with ## introducing comments:
 *
 *                  /home/fred             ## root of the tree to be searched -- a directory
 *                      |
 *           +----------+----------+
 *           |          |          |
 *         movies      docs       code     ## subdirectories
 *           |          |          |
 *          ...        ...      Foo.java   ## non-directory file Foo.java
 *
 * The search starts at the specified directory /home/fred, which contains three
 * subdirectories: movies, docs, and code. Searching each of these subdirectories
 * generates a new task, as a directory is a file that contains other files. If a
 * non-directory file is found (e.g., Foo.java), and this file has the desired
 * extension (in this case, ".java"), then the file is added to the list of 
 * found files: this is a base case, and so no new task is generated.
 *
 * Java's Fork/Join framework is a high-level API for the 'scatter/gather' idiom:
 * scatter ('fork') the tasks to be handled among different threads, then gather ('join') 
 * the results together.
